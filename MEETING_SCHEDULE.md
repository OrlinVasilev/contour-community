# Community Meeting Schedule

We have four Contour community conference calls every month. They happen on alternating times on Tuesdays, with one meeting catering to the APAC region, and a second meeting catering to Europe and Americas region. We will use these meetings to communicate updates to the project, listen to feedback from the community, and also collect requirements/use cases for new features. Sometimes, we may also host adhoc meetings with a specific agenda. 
* APAC-friendly time zone:
   * Every first and third Tuesday at 6:30 PM Eastern Time / 3:30 PM Pacific Time / Wednesday at 9:30 AM Australian Eastern Time.
* Europe/Americas time zone:
   * Every second and fourth Tuesday at 1 PM Eastern Time / 10 AM Pacific Time
* `There is no meeting on the months that have a fifth Tuesday`
